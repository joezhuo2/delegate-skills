name: codex-delegate
description: Delegate light/medium self-contained tasks (boilerplate, tests, docs, small refactors, single-feature edits, code review, research) to OpenAI Codex via headless `codex exec`. Use when a task is well-specified, bounded to a few files, and does not need this conversation's context. Skip for architecture, subtle bugs, or anything needing back-and-forth. Follow the delegate-skills level (low, medium, ultra) given in session context.

# codex-delegate

Offload bounded work to Codex. Claude stays orchestrator and reviewer.

## Delegation level

Set with `/delegate low|medium|ultra` (default `medium`); a SessionStart hook prints the saved level into each session.

- `low`: delegate only when the user explicitly asks.
- `medium`: delegate when the task fits the rules below.
- `ultra`: prefer delegating over doing the work yourself; while the `claude` part is enabled, choose between this worker and a Claude subagent per task (see `claude-delegate`), otherwise prefer this worker over Claude subagents. Delegate anything a worker can do; keep orchestration, review and work no worker can do. Fall back only when gates block or the worker fails.

## When to delegate

Delegate when ALL hold:
- Spec fits in one self-contained prompt (no need for this chat's history).
- Touches roughly 1-5 files.
- Verifiable by a command (tests, build, lint) or by reading the diff.
- Not security-sensitive, not architecture, not a subtle/concurrency bug.

Good fits: test suites, boilerplate, docs/README, mechanical refactors, small features with clear spec, second-opinion review, codebase Q&A.
Keep in Claude: design decisions, ambiguous requirements, cross-repo changes, debugging that needs iteration.

## Gate (automatic)

`codex-run.ps1` runs `codex-gate.ps1` first. It blocks (exit 3, `GATE_BLOCKED: <why>`) unless the Codex login is on the **plus** plan and neither the 5h nor weekly window is >= 95% used (read from the newest `~/.codex/sessions` rate_limits entry; a window past its reset counts as 0%). On block: do the task yourself or with a normal subagent. Do not retry in a loop. Check without running: `& "<skill dir>\codex-gate.ps1"`.

## Model choice (Claude decides, always medium effort)

- `gpt-6.1-sol` (default): routine work: tests, boilerplate, docs, mechanical refactors, small clear features, reviews.
- `gpt-6-astra`: harder medium work: several interacting files, some ambiguity, tricky logic. Costs more usage; if the task needs more than this, keep it in Claude.

Pass with `-Model gpt-6-astra`.

## How

Run the wrapper (PowerShell). The scripts sit next to this SKILL.md; use this skill's base directory as `<skill dir>`:

```powershell
& "<skill dir>\codex-run.ps1" -Prompt "<task>" -Cwd "<project dir>" [-Write] [-Model gpt-6.1-sol|gpt-6-astra] [-TimeoutSec 600]
```

- Default is read-only sandbox (review, research, analysis).
- `-Write` = `workspace-write` sandbox: Codex may edit files inside `-Cwd` only.
- Long jobs: run with `run_in_background` and wait for the notification.
- Output = Codex's final message. On failure prints `CODEX_FAILED` / `CODEX_TIMEOUT` plus stderr tail.

## Prompt template

Codex has no access to this conversation. Include:
1. Goal (one sentence).
2. Exact files/dirs in scope, and what NOT to touch.
3. Conventions to follow (point at an example file).
4. Done criteria + verify command (e.g. `npm test`).
5. "Do not commit. Report changed files and anything unverified."

## After Codex returns (mandatory)

1. `git diff` / `git status` in the project. Read the diff.
2. Re-run the verify command yourself. Do not trust Codex's "tests pass."
3. Fix small issues directly; for big misses, re-delegate with sharper prompt or take over.
4. Tell the user what Codex did and what you verified.

## Rules

- Never delegate with secrets in the prompt.
- Never pass `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`; wrapper never uses it.
- Codex edits are uncommitted; Claude owns commits.
- One Codex job per file set at a time; no parallel writers on same files.
- If `codex.exe` missing: `~/.codex/.sandbox-bin/codex.exe` ships with the Codex desktop app; reinstall the app.
