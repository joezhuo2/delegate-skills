name: kiro-delegate
description: Delegate a self-contained task to Kiro CLI running Claude Opus, Sonnet or Haiku 5.5, as an extra worker beside normal subagents. Use when a task is well-specified, bounded, and can run headless (implementation, tests, docs, reviews, research), and the Kiro CLI is installed and logged in. Follow the delegate-skills level (low, medium, ultra) given in session context.

# kiro-delegate

Run `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive` as a worker. Claude stays orchestrator and reviewer.

## Delegation level

Set with `/delegate low|medium|ultra` (default `medium`); a SessionStart hook prints the saved level into each session.

- `low`: delegate only when the user explicitly asks.
- `medium`: delegate when the task fits the rules below.
- `ultra`: prefer delegating over doing the work yourself; while the `claude` part is enabled, choose between this worker and a Claude subagent per task (see `claude-delegate`), otherwise prefer this worker over Claude subagents. Delegate anything a worker can do; keep orchestration, review and work no worker can do. Fall back only when gates block or the worker fails.

## Gate (automatic)

`kiro-run.ps1` first runs `kiro-gate.ps1`. It blocks (exit 3, `GATE_BLOCKED: <why>`) if `kiro-cli` is missing or not logged in. If blocked, use a normal Claude subagent instead. If the user needs to sign in, tell them to run `kiro-cli login` (browser sign-in); never try to log in yourself. A usage or credit limit shows up as `KIRO_LIMIT`; fall back, do not retry.

## Tier choice (Claude decides)

Pass `-Tier`; the script lists `kiro-cli chat --list-models` and picks the newest model of that tier.

- `haiku`: boilerplate, docs, formatting, mechanical edits, log/JSON munging.
- `sonnet` (default): features with a clear spec, multi-file fixes, test suites, reviews.
- `opus`: architecture, subtle bugs, large refactors, hard reasoning.

`-Model <exact id>` overrides the tier.

## How

The scripts sit next to this SKILL.md; use this skill's base directory as `<skill dir>`:

```powershell
& "<skill dir>\kiro-run.ps1" -Prompt "<task>" -Cwd "<project dir>" [-Tier haiku|sonnet|opus] [-Model <id>] [-Write] [-TimeoutSec 900]
```

- Default is read-only (`--trust-tools=fs_read`).
- `-Write` uses `--trust-all-tools`: Kiro may run commands and edit files. Use only on a git repo you can diff, never with secrets in the prompt.
- Long jobs: run with `run_in_background` and wait for the notification.
- Output starts with `model=<id>` then Kiro's reply.

## Prompt template

Kiro has no access to this conversation. Include: goal, files in scope and out of scope, conventions (point at an example file), done criteria with a verify command, and "Do not commit. Report changed files and anything unverified."

## After Kiro returns (mandatory)

1. Read `git diff` / `git status`.
2. Re-run the verify command yourself.
3. Fix small issues directly; re-delegate or take over for big misses.
4. Tell the user what Kiro did and what you verified.

## Notes

- Kiro CLI on Windows: install the official MSI listed in `https://prod.download.cli.kiro.dev/stable/latest/manifest.json` (check the sha256), then `kiro-cli login`.
- Model ids come from the user's own login; if no model matches the tier, `KIRO_NO_MODEL` prints the listing.
- Headless auth alternative: `KIRO_API_KEY` (needs a Pro-or-higher Kiro plan).
